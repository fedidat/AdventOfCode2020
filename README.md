## AdventOfCode2019

These will be my solutions for [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) 2020. I hope to learn a new language as usual. Here we go!

### Days

1. Elixir. Nope, this is basically Ruby on Erlang and I dislike Ruby. Refactoring to allow other languages.
2. Kotlin. This is special, I might come back to it.
3. Java. This is my home language and I really enjoy it, the syntax is so consistent. Java 15 is really powerful as well, too bad half the world is stuck on Java 8.
4. C++. Back after many years. It changed a lot and it's decent but you can feel that it's an old language with piles of bandaid. Rust if the successor.
5. Rust. It's been a year and it's really very powerful. It's notably much better than C++ in most areas but the borrow checker and other features are bothersome for quick prototyping like this. At least everything makes sense.
