## AdventOfCode2019

These will be my solutions for [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) 2020. I hope to learn new languages as usual. Here we go!

### Days

1. Elixir. Nope, this is basically Ruby on Erlang and I dislike Ruby. Refactoring to allow other languages.
2. Kotlin. This is special, I might come back to it.
3. Java. This is my home language and I really enjoy it, the syntax is so consistent. Java 15 is really powerful as well, too bad half the world is stuck on Java 8.
4. C++. Back after many years. It changed a lot and it's decent but you can feel that it's an old language with piles of bandaid. Rust is the worthy successor.
5. Rust. It's been a year and it's really very powerful. It's notably much better than C++ in most areas but the borrow checker and other features are bothersome for quick prototyping like this. At least everything makes sense.
6. Typscript and Deno. This is good, perhaps better than Java. Strong typing, syntax that makes sense, easy prototyping almost to the level of Python. Install [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.5.4/getting_started/installation) and run `deno test --allow-read`. Regarding Deno it's a better experience than node.js from the standard library alone, but I've barely tried all the features.
